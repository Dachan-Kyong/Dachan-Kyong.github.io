## **About Big-O Notation**
[What is Big-O Notation?](https://dachan-kyong.github.io/posts/about-big-O-notation/)


## **What is O(n)?**
The algorithm's performance grows linearly with the input size. As the input size doubles, the runtime or space usage also doubles.



## **O(n) Examples & Explanations: Java**

### Printing Elements of an Array
```java
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int num : nums) {
    System.out.println(num);  // Printing each element
}
```
Explanation: Printing each element of an array takes linear time because the number of operations is proportional to the size of the array.

### Finding the Maximum Element in an Array
```java
int[] nums = {8, 3, 10, 5, 2};
int max = nums[0];
for (int num : nums) {
    if (num > max) {
        max = num;  // Updating max if a larger element is found
    }
}
```
Explanation: Finding the maximum element in an array requires examining each element, making it a linear time operation.

### Counting the Number of Characters in a String
```java
String str = "Hello, World!";
int count = 0;
for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
    if (Character.isLetter(ch)) {
        count++;  // Counting letters in the string
    }
}
```
Explanation: Counting the number of letters in a string involves iterating through each character, resulting in linear time complexity.

### Copying Elements from One Array to Another
```java
int[] sourceArray = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
int[] destArray = new int[sourceArray.length];
for (int i = 0; i < sourceArray.length; i++) {
    destArray[i] = sourceArray[i];  // Copying elements
}
```
Explanation: Copying elements from one array to another takes linear time since each element needs to be copied.

### Searching for an Element in an Unsorted Array
```java
int[] nums = {5, 3, 8, 2, 10};
int target = 8;
for (int num : nums) {
    if (num == target) {
        System.out.println("Found");  // Searching for target element
        break;
    }
}
```
Explanation: Searching for an element in an unsorted array may require iterating through all elements, resulting in linear time complexity.

These basic examples above demonstrate operations that scale linearly with the input size, aligning with the concept of linear time complexity (O(n)) where the algorithm's performance grows linearly as the input size increases.

In the following posts, I will provide more examples and explanations for each type of complexity.
