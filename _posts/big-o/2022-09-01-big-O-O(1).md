## **About Big-O Notation**
[What is Big-O Notation?](https://dachan-kyong.github.io/posts/about-big-O-notation/)

## **What is O(1)?**
The algorithm's runtime or space usage remains constant regardless of the input size. It takes the same amount of time or space to execute, regardless of how large the input is.


## **O(1) Examples & Explanations: Java**

### Assigning a Value to a Variable
```java
int x = 5;  // Assigning a value to variable x
```
Explanation: Assigning a value to a variable takes a constant amount of time regardless of the value being assigned.

### Comparing Two Numbers
```java
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
boolean isGreater = a > b;  // Comparing a and b
```
Explanation: Comparing two numbers using a comparison operator (like > or <) takes constant time.

### Returning a Constant Value
```java
public int getConstantValue() {
    return 42;  // Returning a constant value
}
```
Explanation: A method that always returns a constant value operates in constant time.

### Basic Arithmetic Operations
```java
int sum = 5 + 7;   // Addition
int diff = 10 - 3;  // Subtraction
int prod = 4 * 6;   // Multiplication
int quotient = 20 / 5;  // Division
```
Explanation: Basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, are constant time operations.

### Accessing the First Element of an Array
```java
int[] nums = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
int firstElement = nums[0];  // Accessing the first element
```
Explanation: Accessing the first element of an array takes a constant amount of time because the index is known.
